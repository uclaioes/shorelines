                                Our oceans experience severe negative impacts from human-induced global warming. Much of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is absorbed by seawater. This leads to ocean warming and acidification, which have cascading effects that impact marine biodiversity and public health. In an effort to guide effective ocean resource management, our team partnered with The Bay Foundation, a non-profit environmental group whose mission is to protect and preserve coastal waters in and around the Santa Monica Bay. We will be researching and developing solutions for the growing issue of ocean acidification. We will focus on how marine vegetation, human actions and coastal policies can help keep our oceans’ pH levels steady.

                                In Spring 2020, members of the Stronger Shorelines practicum team used <i>Zoom</i> to interview scientists who work closely with marine vegetation across the United States. Topics included, but are not limited to: stressors to marine vegetation and whether these issues were universal or habitat-specific, potential solutions to seagrass habitat loss, restoration techniques, typical field and lab work, how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their work, and restoration success stories. We organized our interviews by the geographic region of research:

    "Description":"In the year 2000 several populations of invasive marine algae, Caulerpa taxifolia, were found in Southern California, specifically in Huntington Beach and in Carlsbad. In Europe and Australia, releases of this species resulted in extensive populations of the seaweed destroying native communities and reducing biodiversity in both native aquatic vegetation and animal communities relying on the vegetation. This project led to the successful removal of the invasive seaweed species, protecting native biodiversity and functioning ecosystems. Surveys conducted verified that the removal of the species was complete. The aim to reduce purple urchin density in the benthic environment allows kelp forests to regrow, supporting fish and invertebrate communities. Currently, 46 acres of kelp forest have been restored using this method. The project has observed increasing biodiversity and biomass in kelp, invertebrate, and fish populations, as well as increases in the availability of recreational fishing targets and increased red urchin yield to fisheries.",

    "Description":"Mission Bay, located in San Diego, California, was once a tidal mudflat that served as an alternating endpoint of the San Diego River along with San Diego Bay. In the early 19th century, San Diego’s importance as a naval and shipping port grew, and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged out what is now Mission Bay in order to save the larger San Diego Bay from sedimentation. Mission Bay has been a recreational area since its creation, and has routine dredging to maintain the bay. This project attempts to mitigate negative impacts from the routine dredging by replanting eelgrass in areas where dredging has damaged the bay ecosystem. This project includes both mapping of the extent of seagrass within Mission Bay as well as the replanting of the seagrass. ",

Urban runoff, development, and sedimentation limits kelp growth, while overfishing reduces competition and predation of purple urchins. Purple urchins consume the kelp holdfasts at the ocean floor and create urchin barrens, destroying kelp forest and related communities that live in the kelp forests. This restoration project aims to reduce purple urchin density in the benthic environment, allowing kelp forests to regrow and support fish and invertebrate communities. Currently, 46 acres of kelp forest have been restored using this method.

    "Description":"New Bedford Harbor, within Buzzards Bay, has seen a lot of the same environmental damages as many of the urban bays and waterways of the United States. RElease of PCBs, in particular, have degraded the coastal ecosystems of New Bedford Harbor. The 1930s eelgrass disease that affected the Atlantic seagrass populations decimated seagrass in Buzzards Bay. \nThis project included surveying eelgrass within New Bedford Harbor, selecting priority areas for eelgrass restoration efforts, and planting eelgrass in these areas to provide aquatic habitats.\n",

    "Description":"West Anacapa Island, in the Northern Channel Islands, California, has had its eelgrass populations decreased by white urchin overgrazing. Divers harvested transplants from nearby Santa Cruz Island, planting over 500 shoots at varying depths at Frenchy’s Cove near West Anacapa Island. \nThe scientists monitored the restoration closely, visiting the site and surveying survival rates monthly. Brittlestar populations inhibited seagrass growth at first, but in 2003 brittlestar populations declined, and within 16 months of transplant the eelgrass populations surpassed transplant densities. \n",

    "Description":"During the 1982-1983 winter season, El Niño storms caused the destruction of 215 acres of kelp forest in Goleta Bay, Santa Barbara County, California. In the years since, no natural restoration of the area has taken place. Kelp forest can help to alter the prevailing currents and protect coastal areas from erosion. \n The scientists have developed a kelp recruiting and growing system that will help the natural recovery of the giant kelp. Methods include providing artificial structures for kelp plants to grow on as well as zones where sand-dwelling kelp beds could reside.",

    "Description":"Kelp forests in Puget Sound, found with rocky shallow substrates, have been disappearing over the course of the twentieth century, much like other marine vegetation in the area. Increased coastal development and decreasing water quality contribute to this decline in marine vegetation populations. \nThe scientists in this restoration effort in Port Gamble Bay used a variety of replanting techniques to encourage kelp regrowth. They used ropes seeded with microscopic juvenile kelp, planting of kelp reproductive parts in new areas, and collecting mature kelp blades and anchoring them in the new restoration area. \n",

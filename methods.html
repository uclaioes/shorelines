                                Mapping is often a necessary first step in the restoration process. Mapping helps define the extent and health of seagrass in both donor and recipient sites, and can be achieved through methods such as diving
                                examinations, ROV assessment, and SONAR mapping.

                                One could also utilize remote sensing technology to compile trend and status maps for the study area prior to implementing the rest of the restoration process. Remote sensing techniques include aerial imagery
                                gathered from vehicles to identify and assess the structure of the seagrass meadow.

                                The success of restoration projects can often be estimated by means of computer modelling. Using knowledge of species survivability and geographic variations, scientists can make reasonable predictions as to what

                                The relationship between water quality stressors and seagrass response is imperative for a successful restoration. Monitoring is typically conducted using intensive sampling at a small number of stations.This
                                process is designed to address the link between environmental change and seagrass condition. These studies can link the factors responsible for changes in seagrass structure and function to changes in water
                                quality. Monitoring occurs at least annually in mid-summer, but may also be conducted quarterly.

                                To assess water quality, underwater sensors at permanent stations need to frequently measure light attenuation, surface irradiance, and water transparency depth.

                                Examining the history of a restoration site is useful for determining possible causes for the degradation of marine vegetation habitats.

                                Looking at the project history of a site is useful because aspects such as location, restoration methodology, and environmental fluctuations, can result in variation in the success rate of the restoration project. Factors to examine include the historical extent and health of the degraded vegetation sites, previous instances of pollution, and causal factors for the deterioration of the sites.

                                Site selection is dependent on the priorities of the specific restoration project. There are multiple things to consider. A historical examination can help determine the success of a site by reviewing the extent and persistence of the vegetation. It also must be decided whether to address causal factors of reduced health (sedimentation, pollution), or to choose locations that are more forgiving to growing vegetation given current conditions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cultural factors tend to drive the intent of restoration projects. For some, restoration can be for restoration’s sake, but given the role of kelp and seagrass as ecosystem builders, restoring sites can help increase the productivity of important fisheries in the area. Choosing sites that maximize recolonization of fishery species can help this goal.

                                Pollution from human activity can create hostile environments for seagrass and kelp growth. Nutrient loading can spark eutrophication, an overgrowth of algae that blocks out needed light from reaching vegetation on the seafloor. Industrial wastewater can also lower the water quality enough to degrade the aquatic ecosystems. The elimination or reduction of this pollution can allow the area to be recolonized.

                                <i>Caulerpa taxifolia</i>, an aggressive invasive seaweed, was subjected to field and lab tests which determined chlorine bleach application was the most effective technique to kill individuals. Mechanical disturbance was minimized, as fragments from parent plants were able to survive and implant elsewhere. The plots of C. taxifolia were treated on-site by covering the plants with a tarp and injecting chlorine bleach underneath or introducing in a pelleted form. Besides lethality, the bleach had the additional benefit of inducing a color change which confirmed individual death.

                                Historic overfishing in the region resulted in a population loss of sea urchin predators and competitors. The sea urchins then exploded in numbers and consumed much of the kelp. Restoration is in progress by means of dive teams manually culling the urchins by crushing or by chemical destruction with quicklime. Kelp naturally regrows in areas where sea urchin numbers have been reduced.

                                A technique that is not always necessary is the utilization of test plots. These allow restoration techniques to be evaluated for success on a small scale before translating the technique to the entire restoration site. While this allows maximum efficacy to be evaluated, it does tend to require a trial period, delaying the restoration of the site.

                                When manually re-establishing seagrass beds, seagrass “donor sites” are utilized. Seed collection from several donor sites can provide genetic diversity for the budding colony. The reproductive shoots, which contain the seeds, are removed from the donor site and are usually transported to an aquaculture facility, where the seeds mature before being planted at the recipient sites.

                                Reproductive shoots were initially harvested by a team of divers. This proved slow and cost-ineffective. A water chestnut harvesting boat was repurposed for cutting and collecting reproductive shoots, which stood taller than the general vegetation and could therefore be harvested without damaging the ecosystem. Seeds were broadcasted by placing the shoots in mesh bags above the sediment, allowing the seeds to drop out when mature. Manual broadcasting was also used to evenly allocate the seeds.

                                Adult plants can be taken in their entirety from donor sites and replanted. This is often done manually, and there exists a variety of techniques for both collection and replanting. Methods for anchoring to the sea floor can include simply burying the shoots, staking the shoots into the ground, burying sod from donor sites, or covering the shoots with a protective mesh.

											With ocean acidification on the rise, the 2016-2017
											practicum team members, Rebecca Ash, Candace Chang,
											Kathleen Lo, Ariel Pezner, Jeric Rosas, and Kelli Wright
											set out to determine how kelp forests could
											affect ocean acidification.
										</p>
										<p>
											Kelp is known to alter the chemical composition of the
											water around them. However, at the time, the extent of
											kelp’s ability to combat ocean acidification had not yet
											been fully explored. Due to a massive
											decrease in canopy size, The Bay Foundation was
											spearheading a restoration project off the coast of Palos
											Verdes. This restoration area was analyzed by the
											practicum team in an effort to determine the
											efficacy of this, and similar sites, as refuges from
											rising acidification.
										</p>
										<!-- Methods -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">
											Methods
										</div>
										<p>
											Using sampling tools, flow-through sensors, and drones,
											the team took a holistic approach to understanding the
											nuances of the kelp forest habitat. They measured multiple
											aspects of water chemistry
											including:
										</p>
										<ul class="bullets mb-3">
											<li>
												Conductivity
											</li>
											<li>
												Temperature
											</li>
											<li>
												Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
											</li>
											<li>
												Salinity
											</li>
											<li>
												Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)
											</li>
											<li>
												Pressure
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Additionally, using a combination of flow-through sensors
											and other sampling techniques, the team measured the
											abundance of phytoplankton in an effort to characterize
											the limitations of their results.
										</p>
										<p>
											In order to show the importance of such habitats, they
											also conducted an in-depth literature review of
											commercially and culturally important species that live
											within kelp forests; specifically focusing on
											how they may react to rising acidification. Lastly, the
											team attempted to understand the spatial scale of any
											results they collected by using a combination of dissolved
											CO2 readings from a flow through
											sensor and drone aerial footage.
										</p>
										<!-- Results -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">

										</div>
										<p>
											Through this research they were able to find that:
										</p>
										<ol class="mb-3">
											<li>
												Kelp forests show promise when it comes to acting as
												refuges to ocean acidification
											</li>
											<li>
												Kelp restorations sites can have significant spatial,
												chemical, and temporal alterations of the water around
												them
											</li>
											<li>
												This kelp site seemed to show an increase in pH
												(decrease in ocean acidification) as the restored site
												began to grow and expand
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											If true, this has major implications on the efficacy and
											importance of restoration practices regarding kelp forests
											in California. On the other hand, it is important to note
											that the above findings were seen
											even when they measured phytoplankton abundance
											(determining that their findings were not largely
											influenced by their photosynthesis rates). They
											acknowledged that there may have been upwelling during
											their
											sampling periods which should have lowered the pH even
											further.
										</p>
										<p>
											The graph below depicts their findings, highlighting the
											separation between the pH levels of offshore and within
											the kelp that seemingly grows as the kelp restoration site
											matures.

											In an effort to build upon the 2016-2017 results, the
											research team of Anna George, Noah Horvath, Destiny
											Johnson, Eileen Ly, Roajhaan Sakaki, and Shang Shi set out
											to better understand how marine vegetation
											can affect ocean acidification. By broadening their scope
											to include both giant kelp and eelgrass, the team
											developed a more comprehensive understanding of the
											interplay between local marine habitats and water
											chemistry.
										</p>
										<p>
											With the continued increase of anthropogenic carbon
											emissions, this research could be imperative to better
											understand what future oceans will look like. As seawater
											absorbs these carbon emissions, oceanic
											acidity increases and threatens shellfish and the chemical
											equilibrium. If the team were to find that seagrass
											meadows and kelp forests can help mitigate the deleterious
											effects of anthropogenic ocean
											acidification, the students would build upon the
											scientific support for conservation and restoration of
											these protective heavens.
										</p>
										<!-- Methods -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">
											Methods
										</div>
										<p>
											To start, the team analyzed satellite photos and sonar
											data to pick three separate sites:
										</p>
										<ol class="mb-3">
											<li>
												Control Sites - devoid of seagrass or kelp
											</li>
											<li>
												Kelp Forests
											</li>
											<li>
												Eelgrass Meadows
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											Solstice Canyon, Malibu was determined to have all three
											of the above sites isolated from one another, lending
											itself to be the prime location to conduct their research.
											Using multiple flow-through sensors
											attached to UCLA’s research vessel <i>Zodiac</i>, the team
											began to measure the surface levels of:
										</p>
										<ul class="bullets mb-3">
											<li>
												Temperature
											</li>
											<li>
												Salinity
											</li>
											<li>
												Conductivity
											</li>
											<li>
												Fluorescence
											</li>
											<li>
												Dissolved CO2
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											However, due to the tricky nature of flow-through sensors,
											the Dissolved CO2 sensor was found to be jammed which may
											have lended to certain limitations in their results.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition, the team used a SmarTROLL sensor, a cylinder
											that can be lowered to different depths to measure a host
											of chemical characteristics of the water column at
											different depths. The characteristics that
											they measured included:
										</p>
										<ul class="bullets mb-3">
											<li>
												Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
											</li>
											<li>
												Actual Conductivity
											</li>
											<li>
												Specific Conductivity
											</li>
											<li>
												Oxidation-Reduction Potential
											</li>
											<li>
												Salinity
											</li>
											<li>
												Total Dissolved SOlids (TDS)
											</li>
											<li>
												Resistivity
											</li>
											<li>
												Density
											</li>
											<li>
												pH
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											This sampling method - in contrast to the flow-through
											sensors - allowed the team to get depth profiles,
											completing a more holistic understanding of the chemical
											changes kelp and or seagrass may have upon the
											water column. Once the team collected their data over a
											period of 3 field days spanning roughly a month, they used
											Excel, MatLab, and Esri ArcGIS to analyze and visualize
											the data.
										</p>
										<!-- Results -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">
											Results
										</div>
										<p>
											The team was able to determine that there were, in fact,
											differences in all three sites. They found that while the
											control regions had fairly stable, more acidic ranges of
											pH, seagrass and kelp sites had wider
											ranges of pH that did trend towards more basic pH. This
											does prove that kelp and seagrass have some influence on
											the surrounding water column, however, it only implies
											that these habitats can reduce the amount
											of acidification.
										</p>
										<p>
											The below graphs are THE MOST significant differences
											between the pH levels of control sites and the respective
											marine vegetative habitats. Additionally, below is a
											spatial map depicting the separation of
											sample sites along the Malibu coast.

											As ocean acidification intensifies along the California
											coast the need for mitigation strategies is becoming more
											and more important. In an effort to determine how seagrass
											meadows could act as buffers or
											refuges for marine organisms, Ryan Distaso, Emma Burckert,
											Mackenzie Jackson, Eyal Li, Gonzalo Gutierrez, Evan
											Gentry, and Britanie Iraheta collected data to show to
											what extent this may be true.
										</p>
										<p>
											Similar to the motivation of the 2016-2017 practicum team,
											this team wanted a more in depth look into this specific
											species of marine vegetation, eelgrass. Moreover, they
											wanted to look into how the density of
											the meadow may affect the species ability to change the
											chemistry of the water column around them.
										</p>
										<!-- Methods -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">
											Methods
										</div>
										<p>
											Similar to past practicum projects, this team used a
											multilateral approach, using a SmarTROLL sensor as well as
											niskin bottles to sample the water column at different
											depths. With these tools the team measured:
										</p>
										<ul class="bullets mb-3">
											<li>
												pH
											</li>
											<li>
												Depth
											</li>
											<li>
												Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
											</li>
											<li>
												Nutrient Concentration
											</li>
											<li>
												Carbonate Chemistry
											</li>
											<li>
												Environmental DNA (eDNA)
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Additionally, the team took a new approach to determining
											the health and density of the seagrass meadows at the
											sampling sites. In order to do so, they mounted the pH
											probe as well as a GoPro camera onto a
											constructed PVC cage that could be lowered to the sea
											floor. They then inferred the density of the seagrass
											meadows using the bottom of the cage as a transect, thus,
											finding the % cover within that transect.
										</p>
										<!-- Results -->
										<div class="subheading mt-3 mb-1">
											Results
										</div>
										<p>
											What the team found was contradictory to both previous
											scientific data as well as their own hypothesis. They
											found little to no difference in the pH and dissolved
											oxygen levels of both high and low density
											sites. This discrepancy could be attributed to multiple
											limitations within this study, namely, a lack of high
											density sites and the presence of other organisms such as
											kelp and phytoplankton in the area. The
											team mentioned that in such environments, it is hard to
											distinguish between effects from the surrounding
											environment and effects caused by the seagrass in
											question. Future projects should focus on eliminating
											confounding variables in order to determine the true
											effects of seagrass upon the chemical composition of the
											water column.
										</p>
										<p>
											Below are data tables that depict their findings regarding
											differences in seagrass shoot density and pH.

											of April 2020, the full paper has not
											yet been published, but the abstract and preliminary
											findings paint a clear picture. The cultivation of kelp
											and shellfish in congruence can greatly improve both the
											overall health and shell thickness of
											mussels, while the kelp ecosystems provide a variable
											“halo effect” that can be quantitatively measured.

											Sarah Traiger and her associates study the variance of
											biochemical profiles in giant kelp forests. What they find
											is that the variability is more pronounced in the surface
											waters and is highly dependent on the
											time of day. Finally, this paper determines that kelp
											forests may have diel influence on pH and dissolved oxygen content due to their
											large productive canopy. However, the paper has yet to be
											published in its entirety and the above
											conclusions were made from the abstract only.
